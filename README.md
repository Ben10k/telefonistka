## Before You Start

As much as possible, we have tried to provide enough tooling to get you up and running quickly and with a minimum of effort. This includes sane defaults for documentation; templates for bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests; and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that will automatically manage stale issues and pull requests. This latter defaults to labeling issues and pull requests as stale after 60 days of inactivity, and closing them after 7 additional days of inactivity. These [defaults](.github/workflows/stale.yml) and more can be configured. For configuration options, please consult the documentation for the [stale action](https://github.com/actions/stale).

In trying to keep this template as generic and reusable as possible, there are some things that were omitted out of necessity and others that need a little tweaking. Before you begin developing in earnest, there are a few changes that need to be made:

- [x] âœ… Select an appropriate license for your project. This can easily be achieved through the 'Add File' button on the GitHub UI, naming the file `LICENSE`, and selecting your desired license from the provided list.
- [x] Update the `<License name>` placeholder in this file to reflect the name of the license you selected above.
- [x] Replace `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]` in [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) with a suitable communication channel.
- [x] Change references to `org_name` to the name of the org your repo belongs to (eg. `wayfair-incubator`):
  - [x] In [`README.md`](README.md)
  - [x] In [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [x] Change references to `repo_name` to the name of your new repo:
  - [x] In [`README.md`](README.md)
  - [x] In [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [x] Update the link to the contribution guidelines to point to your project:
  - [x] In [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/BUG_REPORT.md`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/BUG_REPORT.md)
  - [x] In [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- [x] Replace the `<project name>` placeholder with the name of your project:
  - [x] In [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
  - [x] In [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)
- [x] Add names and contact information for actual project maintainers to [`MAINTAINERS.md`](MAINTAINERS.md).
- [x] Delete the content of [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). We encourage you to [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
- [ ] Configure [`renovate.json`](renovate.json) for your project's language and tooling dependencies.
  - [ ] Note that the base `renovate.json` file included with this template inherits most of its configuration logic from Wayfair OSPO's recommended presets, hosted [here](https://github.com/wayfair/ospo-automation/blob/main/default.json). If your project does not require advanced dependency configuration, this may be sufficient for your needs.
  - [ ] ðŸ’¡ To learn more about using and configuring [Renovate](http://renovatebot.com/), check out our [wayfair.github.io](https://wayfair.github.io) article: **[Managing Project Dependencies](https://wayfair.github.io/docs/managing-dependencies/)**.
- [ ] Replace the generic content in this file with the relevant details about your project.
- [ ] Acknowledge that some features like [branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule) are only available when the repo is `public`.

## About The Project

Promoter is a Github Webhook Bot that facilitate promotions in a Iac GitOps repo that models environments and sites as folders.

Based on configuration in the IaC repo, the bot will open Pull Requests that syncs components from "sourcePath"s to "targetPaths".

Providing reasnably flexible control over what is promoted to where and in what order.

Notable Features:
----------------

* IaC technology agnostic -  Terraform, Helmfile, ArgoCD whatever, as long as environments and sites are modeled as folders and components are copied "as is".

* Multi stage promotion schemes like  
  ```
  lab -> staging -> production
  ```
  or  
  ```
  dev -> production-us-east-1 -> production-us-east-3 -> production-eu-east-1
  ```  
  Fan out, like:  
  ```
  lab -> staging1 -->
         staging2 -->  prodction
         staging3 -->
  ```

* Control over grouping of targetPaths syncs in PRs ("sync all dev clusters in one PR but open a dedicated PR for every production cluster" )
* Optional in-component allow/block override list("this component should not be deployed to production" or "deploy this only in the us-east-4 region")
* Drift detection - warns user on "unsynced" environment on open PRs ("Staging the Production are not synced, these are the differences")

### Server Configuration ###
-------------
Environment variables for the webhook process:

`APPROVER_GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN` GitHub oAuth token for automatically approving promotion PRs

`GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN` GitHub main oAuth token for all other GH operations

`GITHUB_URL` URL for github API (needed for Github Enterprise)

`GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` secret used to sign webhook payload to be validated by the WH server, must match the sting in repo settings/hooks page

Behavior of the bot is configured by YAML files **in the target repo**:


### Repo Configuration ###
Pulled from `telefonistka.yaml` file in the repo root directory(default branch)

Configuration keys:  
- `promotionPaths` Array of maps, each map describes a promotion flow:  
- - `   sourcePath`: directory that holds components(subdirectories) to be synced, can include a regex.  
- - `   conditions`: conditions for triggering a specific promotion flows(flows are evauated in order, first one to match is triggered.  
- - - `   prHasLabels`: Array of PR labels, if the triggering PR has any of these lables the condition is considered fulfilled. Currently its the only supported condition type.  
- - `   targetPaths`: Array of arrays(!!!) of target paths tied to the source path mentioned above, each top level element represent a PR that will be opened, so multiple target can be synced in a single PR.  
- `dryRunMode`: if true, the bot will just comment the planned promotion on the merged PR.  
- `autoApprovePromotionPrs`: if true the bot will auto-approve all promotion PRs, with the assumption the original PR was peer reviewed and is promoted verbatim. Required additional GH token via APPROVER_GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN env variable.  
- `toggleCommitStatus`: Map of strings, allow (non-repo-admin) users to change the [Github commit status](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/statuses) state(from failure to success and back). This can be used to continue promotion of a change that doesn't pass repo checks. the keys are strings commented in the PRs, values are [Github commit status context](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/statuses?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-commit-status) to be overridden.



Example:
```yaml
promotionPaths:
  - sourcePath: "workspace/"
    targetPaths:
      - 
        - "clusters/dev/iad1/c2"
        - "clusters/sdedev/grq1/c1"
        - "clusters/sdeprod/dsm1/c1"
        - "clusters/sdeprod/dsm1/c2"
        - "clusters/sdeprod/grq1/c1"
  - sourcePath: "clusters/sdeprod/[^/]*/[^/]*" # This will start a promotion to prod from any "sdeprod" path
    conditions:
      prHasLabels:
        - "quick_promotion" # This flow will run only if PR has "quick_promotion" label, see targetPaths below
    targetPaths:
      -
        - "clusters/prod/pdx1/c2" # First PR for only a single cluster
      -
        - "clusters/prod/fra1/c2" # 2nd PR will sync all 4 remaining clusters
        - "clusters/prod/grq1/c2"
        - "clusters/prod/dsm1/c2"
        - "clusters/prod/iad1/c2"
  - sourcePath: "clusters/sdeprod/[^/]*/[^/]*" # This flow will run on PR without "quick_promotion" label
    targetPaths:
      -
        - "clusters/prod/pdx1/c2" # Each cluster will have its own promotion PR
      -
        - "clusters/prod/fra1/c2"
      -
        - "clusters/prod/grq1/c2"
      -
        - "clusters/prod/dsm1/c2"
      -
        - "clusters/prod/iad1/c2"
dryRunMode: true
autoApprovePromotionPrs: true
toggleCommitStatus:
  override-terrafrom-pipeline: "github-action-terraform"
```


### Component Configuration ###

This optional in-component configuation file allows overriding the general promotion configuation for a specific component.  
File location is `COPONENT_PATH/telefonistka.yaml` (no leading dot in file name), so it could be:  
`workspace/reloader/telefonistka.yaml` or `env/prod/dsm1/c2/wf-kube-proxy-metrics-proxy/telefonistka.yaml`  
it includes only two optional configuation keys, `promotionTargetBlockList` and `promotionTargetAllowList`.  
Both are matched against the target component path using Golang regex engine.

If a target path matches an entry in `promotionTargetBlockList` it will not be promoted(regardless of `promotionTargetAllowList`).

If  `promotionTargetAllowList` exist(non empty), only target paths that matches it will be promoted to(but the previous statement about `promotionTargetBlockList` still applies).


```yaml
promotionTargetBlockList:
  - env/sdeprod/grq1/c1.*
  - env/prod/dsm1/c3/
promotionTargetAllowList:
  - env/prod/.*
  - env/sde.*
```

Development
-----------

* use Ngrok ( `ngrok http 8080` ) to expose the local instance
* See the URLs in ngrok command output.
* Add a webhook to repo setting e.g. `https://github.csnzoo.com/ob136j/k8s-gitops-poc/settings/hooks`
(don't forget the `/webhook` path in the URL).
* Content type needs to be `application/json`, **currently** only PR events are needed
